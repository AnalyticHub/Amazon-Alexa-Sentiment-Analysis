## Amazon-Alexa-Sentiment-Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon Alexa reviews using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing textual data, applying sentiment analysis using VADER, and deploying a Flask web application for real-time sentiment prediction.
## Problem Statements
Businesses need to understand the sentiment behind customer reviews to gauge product satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. Processing and analyzing large volumes of textual data from Amazon Alexa reviews efficiently is challenging and time-consuming.
Achieving accurate sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral) from diverse and unstructured textual data poses a significant challenge. Businesses require real-time analysis and prediction of sentiment from new customer reviews to respond promptly and effectively. Deploying sentiment analysis models in a scalable and accessible manner, especially on cloud platforms like AWS, involves technical complexities.
## Solutions
Implement sentiment analysis techniques using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and libraries such as NLTK and VADER to categorize reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
Utilize efficient data processing techniques with libraries like Pandas and NumPy to handle and preprocess large datasets. Implement parallel processing or distributed computing if necessary for scalability.
Train machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), on preprocessed textual data to improve accuracy in sentiment prediction. Use techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.Develop a Flask web application that integrates backend sentiment analysis models with user-friendly HTML templates. Implement functionality to preprocess new user reviews in real-time, predict sentiment using pre-trained models, and display results dynamically.
Deploy the Flask application on cloud platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalability and accessibility. Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy deployment and management of application dependencies. Monitor application performance and scale resources as needed to handle varying traffic loads.
