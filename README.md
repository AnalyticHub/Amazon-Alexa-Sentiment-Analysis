## Amazon-Alexa-Sentiment-Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon Alexa reviews using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing textual data, applying sentiment analysis using VADER, and deploying a Flask web application for real-time sentiment prediction.
## Problem Statements
Businesses need to understand the sentiment behind customer reviews to gauge product satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. Processing and analyzing large volumes of textual data from Amazon Alexa reviews efficiently is challenging and time-consuming.
Achieving accurate sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral) from diverse and unstructured textual data poses a significant challenge. Businesses require real-time analysis and prediction of sentiment from new customer reviews to respond promptly and effectively. Deploying sentiment analysis models in a scalable and accessible manner, especially on cloud platforms like AWS, involves technical complexities.
